# AR Pong
AR Pong is a simple augmented reality Pong game built with opencv. Using motion
detection, hit detection, and velocity estimation players can use webcams to
interact with a virtual ball. Use your hands as paddles as you try to hit the ball
in the other player's endzone. The game has a scoring system that keeps track of
who is winning in this physical game of Pong.
